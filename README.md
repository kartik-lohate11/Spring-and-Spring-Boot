# Spring Boot Learning Notes

Welcome to my Spring Boot learning repository! Here, I document my journey as I dive into the world of Spring Boot development. Below, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources I've gathered along the way.

## Overview

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies the process of creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Spring Boot, here's a quick guide to get you started:

- Install Java and Maven/Gradle on your system.
- Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE.
- Explore the project structure and configuration files.
- Start building your application by adding controllers, services, and repositories.

## Key Concepts

As I progress in my learning journey, I've encountered several key concepts in Spring Boot:

- **Dependency Injection**: Spring Boot leverages dependency injection to manage the components of your application, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
- **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot provides automatic configuration for common application setups, reducing the need for manual configuration.
- **Spring Data**: Integrating with Spring Data makes it easy to work with databases in your Spring Boot applications, supporting various databases and reducing boilerplate code.
- **RESTful APIs**: Spring Boot simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs using annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.

## Examples

Here are some examples of code snippets I've created while learning Spring Boot:

### Hello World Controller

```java
@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
